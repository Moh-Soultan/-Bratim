                 <p style="color:#fff; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" >At the graduate school level, students seek a variety of master's degrees, either in general management–very commonly the MBA–or in a specific area, such as marketing or finance. A further distinction is that students pursuing postgraduate degrees often have some business experience, although this is not always a program requirement.

                    Corresponding to both of these, graduate degrees in business and management are generally of two types: On the one hand, programs such as the Master of Science (M.Sc.) or Arts (MA) or Commerce (M.Com.) in General Management (sometimes also called Master in Management, or MIM) usually do not require professional experience. (Often the M.Sc. in Management is for graduates with a first academic degree in a social science, while the MA in Management is for other backgrounds. The Master of Engineering Management, MEM, is aimed at graduates with an engineering background.) On the other hand, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) requires a minimum of two to three years of professional experience and is open for graduates from any field. A related distinction: the M.Sc. in Management is more specialized than an MBA, and is more suited for academic research, while the MBA is more industry- and management-focused.
                    
                    As regards degree structure, postgraduate business programs are, in general, designed such that students gain exposure to theory and practice alike;[8] the mix, though, will differ by degree and by school,[9] as discussed. Learning is through lectures, case studies, and often team projects ("syndicate" work). The theory is covered in the classroom setting by academic faculty. Particularly in the MBA, the theory is then reinforced, and revisited, also in the classroom setting, through the case method, placing the student in the role of the decision maker, "complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real business issues." Practical learning often comprises consulting projects with real clients, or at least addressing an actual case, and is often undertaken in teams. The practical elements (as well as the case studies) may involve external practitioners, and sometimes executives, supporting the teaching from academic faculty. (See Business school#Use of case studies and #Other approaches.) One of the challenges for business academics is demonstrating that their curriculum is relevant to those who want to become managers.[10</p>
